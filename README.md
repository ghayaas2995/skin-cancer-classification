# Melanoma_Detection
This project aims at classifying Skin Lesions based on different classes. The dataset used for training the models are:
- ISIC 2018
- ISIC 2019

The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model in the context of the multi-class classification of skin lesions. The proposed Deep Convolutional Neural Network model is carefully designed with several layers, and multiple filter sizes, and manipulates filters and layers to improve the efficacy and accuracy. Dermoscopic images are acquired from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration databases (ISIC-18 and 19) for experiments.


The goal is to classify dermoscopic images among eight different diagnostic categories: Melanoma, Melanocytic nevus, Basal cell carcinoma, Actinic keratosis, Benign keratosis, Dermatofibroma, Vascular lesion, and Squamous cell carcinoma.

The repo follows the following structure:

- Documentation: Contains various project related documents with detailled explanation of processes performed.
    - PreProcessing_201X: Contains detailed explanation of step-wise approach taken to process images from all the different classes for ISIC 2018 & ISIC 2019 dataset. 
    -  ISIC_201X_augmenations_summary: The excel files corresponding to each dataset consists a summarised description of augmentations performed on each class with information on number of images augmented, parameters of techniques used and final count of images of each class.
