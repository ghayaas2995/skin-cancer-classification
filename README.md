# Skin cancer classification
This project aims at classifying Skin Lesions based on different classes. The dataset used for training the models are:
- ISIC 2018
- ISIC 2019

The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model in the context of the multi-class classification of skin lesions. The proposed Deep Convolutional Neural Network model is carefully designed with several layers, and multiple filter sizes, and manipulates filters and layers to improve the efficacy and accuracy. Dermoscopic images are acquired from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration databases (ISIC-18 and 19) for experiments.


The goal is to classify dermoscopic images among eight different diagnostic categories: Melanoma, Melanocytic nevus, Basal cell carcinoma, Actinic keratosis, Benign keratosis, Dermatofibroma, Vascular lesion, and Squamous cell carcinoma.
